            <h2>75 Public Square</h2>
            <p>75 Public Square is a high-rise office building on Public Square in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. It was
                designed by the Cleveland architectural firm of Hubbell &amp; Benes and was completed in 1915. It served
                as the headquarters for the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company until the construction of the
                adjacent 55 Public Square in 1958. The building also abuts Cleveland's historic Old Stone Church. In
                2014, the Millenia Companies, planning to convert the building into apartments, purchased the building
                for $4 million.</p>

            <h2>55 Public Square</h2>
            <p>55 Public Square (formerly known as the Illuminating Building, after the Illuminating Company, the
                building's primary tenant) is a 22-story skyscraper located at number 55 Public Square, the town square
                of downtown Cleveland, Ohio. Designed by Carson Lundin &amp; Shaw Architects, it is 300 feet (91 m)
                tall, was completed in 1958, and was the first new skyscraper built in Cleveland since the Terminal
                Tower complex was completed in 1930. It was also the first tall International Style building in the city
                and the first to use a reinforced concrete frame. The consulate general of Slovenia is located in the
                building.</p>

            <h2>Public Square</h2>
            <p>Public Square is the two-block (formerly four-block) central plaza of downtown Cleveland, Ohio. Based on
                an 18th-century New England model, it was part of the original 1796 town plat overseen by Moses
                Cleaveland, and remains today as an integral part of the city's center. The 10-acre (4.0 ha) square is
                centered on the former intersection of Superior Avenue and Ontario Street. Cleveland's three tallest
                buildings, Key Tower, 200 Public Square and the Terminal Tower, face the square.</p>

            <p>The Society for Savings Building, also known as the Society Corp. Building, is a high-rise building on
                Public Square in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The building was constructed in 1889, and
                stood as the tallest building in Cleveland until 1896, when it was surpassed by the 221-foot (67 m)
                Guardian Bank Building. The building stands 152 feet (46 m) tall, with 10 floors. The Society for
                Savings Building is often considered to be the first modern skyscraper in Cleveland and the state of
                Ohio. It was designed by John Wellborn Root of the Chicago-based architectural firm Burnham &amp; Root.

                starburst motif. The south face, which can be seen from Public Square, is unadorned and windowless. It
                was designed by Knox and Elliot architects, and was built for $7 million. It was built by the
                Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen who owned the building until 2014, when it was sold to
                Weston, Inc.</p>
